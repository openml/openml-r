  - as.data.frame methods for OMLRunParList, OMLDataSet and OMLTasks objects were added.

  - getOMLRun(run.id, only.xml = TRUE) can now be used to get the run without the predictions arff file (which is faster, especially when you are only interested in, e.g. getting the hyperparameters of a run.)
