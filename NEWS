===========

  - New functions to get the IDs of suggested datasets/tasks that can be used for bechmark experiments getOMLBenchmarkDataSetIds, getOMLBenchmarkTaskIds.

===========
  - Bugfix: Error message "Start tag expected, '<' not found" for getOMLTask and getOMLDataSet was fixed.
  - as.data.frame methods for OMLRunParList, OMLDataSet and OMLTasks objects were added.
  - listOMLRunEvaluations now allows to get results w.r.t. a single evaluation measure ('evaluation.measure' arg) which speeds up the request.
  - listOMLRuns and listOMLRunEvaluations now also supports a vector of ids for task.id, flow.id and uploader.id.
  - getOMLRun(run.id, only.xml = TRUE) can now be used to get the run without the predictions arff file (which is faster, especially when you are only interested in, e.g. getting the hyperparameters of a run.)
