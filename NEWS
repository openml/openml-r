===========
  - Fixed bug in listOMLSetup.

  - New function extractOMLStudyIds added, which directly extracts ids of data sets, tasks, flows and runs.

OpenML 1.7 (Release date: 2017-10-17):
===========
  - listOMLTask, listOMLFlow, listOMLRuns do not return the tag field anymore.
  - New function listOMLSetup added, which enables extracting hyperparameter configurations of specific setups/flows.

  - as.data.frame methods for OMLRunParList, OMLDataSet and OMLTasks objects were added.
  - listOMLRunEvaluations now allows to get results w.r.t. a single evaluation measure ('evaluation.measure' arg) which speeds up the request.
  - listOMLRuns and listOMLRunEvaluations now also supports a vector of ids for task.id, flow.id and uploader.id.
  - getOMLRun(run.id, only.xml = TRUE) can now be used to get the run without the predictions arff file (which is faster, especially when you are only interested in, e.g. getting the hyperparameters of a run).
