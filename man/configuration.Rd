\description{
After loading the package, it tries to find a configuration in your home
directory. The R command \code{path.expand("~/.openml/config")} gives you the
full path to the configuration file on your operating system.

For further information please read the
\href{https://openml.github.io/openml-r}{vignette}.
}
\note{
By default the cache directory is located in a temporary directory and
the cache will be deleted in between R sessions. We thus recommend to set
the cache directory by hand.
