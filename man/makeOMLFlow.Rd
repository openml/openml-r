\arguments{
\item{flow.id}{[\code{integer(1)}]\cr
ID of the flow. Generated by the server, based on name and version of the flow.
Ignored when uploaded manually.}

\item{uploader}{[\code{integer(1)}]\cr
The user that uploaded the flow. Added by the server. Ignored when uploaded manually.}

\item{name}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr
The name of the flow. Name-version combinations should be unique.\cr
Allowed characters: () [] a-z A-Z 0-9 . _ - +}

\item{version}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr
The version of the flow. Default is 1.0. Ignored at upload time.}

\item{description}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr
A user description of the flow.}

\item{creator}{[\code{character}]\cr
Optional. The persons/institutions that created the flow.}

\item{contributor}{[\code{character}]\cr
Optional. (Minor) contributors to the workflow}

\item{upload.date}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr
The date on which the flow was uploaded.\cr
Format YYYY-mm-ddThh:MM:SS.
Added by the server. Ignored when uploaded manually.}

\item{licence}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr
Optional. Default is none, meaning Public Domain or "don't know/care".}

Optional. Starts with one upper case letter, rest is lower case. Default is English.}

\item{full.description}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr
Optional. Full description of the workflow, e.g, man pages filled in by tool.
This is a much more elaborate description than given in the 'description field'. It may include
information about all components of the workflow.}

\item{installation.notes}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr
Optional. Additional hints on how to run the flow.}

\item{dependencies}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr

The parameters of the flow. A list containing
\code{\link{OMLFlowParameter}s}.}

\item{components}{[\code{list}]\cr
A list containing \code{\link{OMLFlow}s}. Typically components of a workflow or
subfunctions of an algorithm (e.g. kernels). Components can have their own parameters.}

\item{qualities}{[\code{list}]\cr
Qualities of the algorithm. Each member of the list is an \code{OMLFlowQuality}.}

MD5 checksum to check if the binary code was uploaded correctly.}

\item{source.path}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr
The path to the cached source file, once \code{\link{getOMLFlow}} was run.}

\item{binary.path}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr
