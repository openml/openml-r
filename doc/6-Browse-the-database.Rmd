===================

Data sets have different characteristics and users might want to work on data sets that meet certain conditions. 

### Get basic data characteristics

The easiest way to retrieve a data.frame containing basic data characteristics like the number of features/instances/classes/missing values etc. of all stored data sets is the following:

```{r eval = FALSE}
data.chars <- getDataCharacteristics()
```

### Get meta learning features
With the function `getMetaLearningFeatures` you can obtain all data qualities of all stored data sets. This includes meta learning features as well as the basic characteristics that can be retrieved by `getDataCharacteristics`. If you only want a few of these data qualities, you can pass them in form of a character vector to the function. A list of all data quality names can be obtained by the function `getDataQualityNames`.

```{r eval = FALSE}
ml.feats <- getMetaLearningFeatures()

dq.names <- getDataQualityNames()
ml.feats <- getMetaLearningFeatures(only = dq.names[1:5])
```

### Make an arbitrary SQL-query
The most free way to browse the OpenML database is by SQL-queries. The function `openMLSQLQuery` is an interface for any arbitrary SQL-query. The query is passed as a string to the function as you can see in the following example:

```{r eval = FALSE}
openMLSQLQuery(SQL = "SELECT id FROM implementation WHERE name = 'classif.rpart'")
```
