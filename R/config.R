#' @description
#' After loading the package, it tries to find a configuration in your home
#' directory. The R command \code{path.expand("~/.openml/config")} gives you the
#' full path to the configuration file on your operating system.
#'
#' For further information please read the
#' \href{https://openml.github.io/openml-r/}{vignette}.
#'
#' @note
#' By default the cache directory is located in a temporary directory and
#' the cache will be deleted in between R sessions. We thus recommend to set
#' the cache directory by hand.
